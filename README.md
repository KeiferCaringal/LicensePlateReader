The software employs an algorithm that combines object detection and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract license plate information from a video stream. Initially, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is utilized for object detection, identifying regions within each frame likely to contain license plate numbers. YOLO, a cutting-edge deep learning method, swiftly draws bounding boxes around these regions, marking them as potential candidates for further analysis. Subsequently, the EasyOCR library applies OCR to these extracted regions, converting the visual data into machine-readable text. This OCR technology enables the recognition of alphanumeric characters on the license plates, facilitating the extraction of the plate numbers. This seamless integration of object detection and OCR underscores the program's ability to accurately identify and extract license plate information from video streams, showcasing the efficacy of computer vision in practical applications such as automatic number plate recognition.
